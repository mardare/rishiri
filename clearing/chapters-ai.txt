machine learning= statistical method for correlation discovery between past events and current state, via predictions
this is a reverse of rule=>action, ml extracts the rules from current and past actions/data,

there is no "thinking", that is why Kasparov could not identify the play/strategy of the algorithm, there is no play/plan, 
there are only new probabilities/plans from each of his moves
